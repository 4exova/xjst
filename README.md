XSLT inspired JavaScript templates (with spices).
Built on [node](http://nodejs.org) and [OMeta/JS](https://github.com/veged/ometa-js).

## Installation

## Examples

It is still at an early stage of development.
The easiest and ugly way to look at examples of this:

    git clone git://github.com/veged/xjst.git
    make -C xjst tests
    make -C xjst tests/menu

More low-level details are available in `tests/tests.js`.

You can also use `bin/xjst` to compile `*.xjst` to CommonJS module.
